# Hi, I'm Joe 👋🏻 (he/him or they/them)

## About me

I really enjoy making things and solving problems, mostly on computers ⌨️ (but not always 📐🛠️🪚).

From January to March 2022, I completed the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) part-time skills bootcamp. I'll be continuing on to their full-time course, which runs from May to July. 🙂

Away from screens, I like walking and cycling 🏙️🌳, dancing in small dark loud rooms 🔊, cooking 🍅, and critter-spotting. 🐶🐱🐦🦊🐀

I care about how technology can be used to have a positive social impact ⚖️, and I hope to work on projects that contribute to this.
