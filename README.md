## About me

I really enjoy making things and solving problems, mostly on computers ‚å®Ô∏è (but not always üìêüõ†Ô∏èü™ö).

From January to March 2022, I completed the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) part-time skills bootcamp, and from May to July I completed their full-time training course.

Since August 2022, I've been working at [Lyfta](https://www.lyfta.com/) as an apprentice software developer.

Away from screens, I like walking and cycling üèôÔ∏èüå≥, dancing in small dark loud rooms üîä, cooking üçÖ, and critter-spotting. üê∂üê±üê¶ü¶äüêÄ

I care about how technology can be used to have a positive social impact ‚öñÔ∏è, and hope I can continue to work on projects that contribute to this.
