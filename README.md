# Hi, I'm Joe 👋🏻

I really enjoy making things and solving problems, mostly on computers ⌨️ (but not always 📐🛠️🪚).

From January to March 2022, I completed the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) part-time skills bootcamp, and from May to July I completed their full-time training course.

From August 2022 to December 2023 I worked at [Lyfta](https://www.lyfta.com/) -- first as an apprentice software developer, and then as a junior developer.

Away from screens, I like walking 🏙️🌳, hiking ⛰️🌄, dancing (in smallish, loud rooms) 🎛️🔊, cooking 🍅🥦, and critter-spotting. 🐶🐱🐦🦊🐀

I care about how technology can be used to have a positive social impact ⚖️, and hope I can continue to work on projects that contribute to this.

## Learning

I'm regularly learning new things, which is one reason I like working with software.

Some online courses I'm currently working through include:

### [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/)

- 🐍 [Python for Programmers](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/python-for-programmers) (56%)
- 🟦 [Everyday TypeScript](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/everyday-typescript) (36%)

### [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

- ✔️ Intro to Machine Learning
- ✔️ Pandas
- ⏳ Intermediate Machine Learning (93%)

In the past 18 months I was focusing on:

- ☕ JavaScript, Node & SPAs
- ⚛️ React, Redux & various associated packages
- 💅🏾 CSS-in-JS approaches like styled-components
- 💎 Ruby on Rails, Active Record & various associated gems
- :octocat: git & GitHub
- 📁 VS Code
- 🌐 Three.js
- ✏️ Figma

Prior to 2022 I already had a decent grounding in HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Linux & (Unix-like) shells/CLI, Perl, and more. It's been particularly enjoyable updating my CSS knowledge, which seems to have _really_ improved since 2012! ✨
