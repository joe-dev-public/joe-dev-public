# Hi, I'm Joe 👋🏻 (he/him or they/them)

## About me

I really enjoy making things and solving problems, mostly on computers ⌨️ (but not always 📐🛠️🪚).

I've done some web development 🌐🔗 in a commercial setting before, but not since 2012.

To broaden and update my skills, I'm currently taking part in the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) part-time bootcamp, and plan to continue with the full-time course.

Away from screens, I like walking and cycling 🏙️🌳, dancing in small dark loud rooms 🔊, cooking 🍅, and critter-spotting. 🐶🐱🐦🦊🐀

I care about how technology can be used to have a positive social impact ⚖️, and I hope to work on projects that contribute to this.
